Customer churn prediction helps businesses reduce customer loss.

## Objective
To build a model that can classify customers as:
- Churn (Yes)
- Not Churn (No)

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-Learn

## Steps Involved
1. Data loading
2. Data cleaning
3. Data analysis
4. Model training
5. Model evaluation
6. Prediction

## Model Used
- Logistic Regression / Random Forest / XGBoost  
(Mention the one you used)

## Model Performance
- Accuracy: XX%
- Confusion Matrix
- Classification Report

## Conclusion
This project shows how Machine Learning can be used to predict customer churn and help businesses make better decisions.
